                        I didn't sleep very well, I hope I'll pull it off.

                        I have a very rough fighting system now. Moving around does nothing yet, I need some code to detect where someone is.
                        It does not take time into account either. I want a system where
                        after selecting an attack there's a period where your opponent
                        does not know which attack you did, but they know you are attacking, so they can choose to react. Hopefully I can do that
                        and still have time left for art tomorrow.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        That rearchitecting was great. I eliminated a bunch of useless code and everything is much prettier and composeable now.
                    </li>

                        I'd like to have some sort of a fencing game where you have a sword, and you can attack and defend.

                        We need a rock paper scissors kind of thing, where any action is weak against one and strong against another. Three actions:

                        pierce attack beats hack attack
                        hack attack beats deflect
                        deflect beats pierce attack

                        Default stance is defend, where no attack has effect.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        So I built animations as just a special case of image having canvas elements. I think it's a bit hacky, but it works fine and I think it's quite maintainable. Now for the game logic part..

                        I think I want to have it be an arena fighter, like street fighter, but obviously more simple. The idea is that every match is at most 10 seconds, if you don't defeat your opponent in 10 seconds you both lose.

                        Also a bit unrelated, but I there's something wrong with my component system, I messed up the way they are updated. I now define functions on the entities, which is a bit retarded. It should be that the functions are just on the components, and they are executed for every entity that has it attached. I also don't like my engines, something is really wrong with them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        What do I want?

                        There's objects that don't need to be redrawn each animationFrame, so they're static objects.

                        There's objects that do need to be redrawn, animated or dynamic objects.

                        An object has one current animation. The animation keeps a frame number, and is timed against realtime.

                        The animation can change at any moment.

                        The animation can have custom update code.

                        A canvas element usually has an image.
                    </li>
                    <li>Processing input took longer than I wanted, I had to help my GF and the keyboard library I usually use wasn't suitable for this purpose. I think the architecture of the game is
                    ok, but I had to think a long time how I want to make sure movement is going to work
                    right in the final game. I've decided components like 'moves_around' are going to state
                    their intent, and the game logic engine will solve the intentions.
                    </li>
                    <li>I've built a pretty decent game engine with entities and components. So far I really like how grunt updates my browser when I change something, but it doesn't pick up on some new files I created yet, perhaps I need to restart it.</li>
                    <li>So I've been working for ~3 hours now. Had a few too many breaks than I wanted but it's ok.</li>
